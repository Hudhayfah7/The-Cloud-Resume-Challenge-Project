# The-Cloud-Resume-Challenge-Project
What is the Cloud Resume Challenge?
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a popular, hands-on project created by Forrest Brazeal, a cloud architect and advocate, to help aspiring cloud professionals gain real-world experience with cloud technologies. This challenge isn’t just another technical exercise — it’s designed to push you to combine your technical skills in a way that mirrors the actual responsibilities of a cloud engineer.
